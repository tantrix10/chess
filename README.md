# chess
I enjoy chess so am making a chess game and engine :) 

Currently all code can be found in play_engine where I'm working on the play and rules engine. 
Once this is complete I will move onto making the visual engine to play and view pgns
Then I'll make the game engine, this will be my attempt at an actual chess engine, let's see how it goes :)
