# chess
I enjoy chess so am making a chess game and engine :) 

Currently all code can be found in play_engine where I'm working on the play and rules engine. 

Once this is complete I will move onto making the visual engine to play and view pgns.

Then I'll make the game engine, this will be my attempt at an actual chess engine, let's see how it goes :) 

n.b. it is worth noting that as it currently stands I think this play engine is pretty poorly written but the idea is just to write something quickly in the evenings that works. Focus on the other elements of the project that rely of this then gut and re-write the play engine.
